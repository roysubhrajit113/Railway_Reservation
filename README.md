# My First Github Repository

## Welcome
- This is my first ever GitHub repository that I created as a dummy, when I first started understanding the basics of GitHub. This repository is not having any significant contributions or projects.
- However, I have decided to keep this repository just to remind myself how far I have come from creating my first simple repository to creating multiple major projects in my entire academic career.
